# Cognifyz Task 1 – Text-Based Game

## Where Data Meets Intelligence

---

## Objective
The objective of this task is to design and implement a basic text-based game using conditional statements to demonstrate logical control in programming.

---

## Task Description
This task involves creating a simple interactive game that runs in a terminal environment. The game is designed to take user input and respond based on defined conditions. It focuses on understanding how decision-making statements guide program execution.

---

## Game Type
Number Guessing Game

---

## Rules of the Game
- The system generates a number within a specified range.
- The player attempts to guess the correct number.
- The game provides feedback after each guess.
- The game ends either when the player guesses correctly or when the maximum attempts are used.

---

## Logic Used
- Conditional statements are used to compare values.
- Loops control the repetition until a valid outcome is reached.
- User input determines the flow of execution.
- Feedback is generated dynamically based on input conditions.

---

## Features
- Text-based user interaction
- Limited attempts for each game session
- Instant user feedback
- Simple and readable logic design

---

## Testing and Verification
The game was executed multiple times using various inputs to ensure:
- Correct output is generated for valid and invalid guesses.
- The game terminates as expected.
- All decisions are handled accurately.

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub
